Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.Turn dough out onto a work surface. For a single-crust pie or tart, divide into 4 portions; for a double-crust pie, divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all dough together, with a pastry scraper if you have one. For single-crust pie or tart, press into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. For a double-crust pie, divide in half, and then flatten each into a 5-inch disk. If dough is sticky, dust lightly with additional flour.

Transfer this mixture to a medium mixing bowl and stir in the water, tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Taste and adjust to your liking - you most likely will need a bit more salt. Set aside.\nSalt the pot of water generously, and boil the broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans. Boil just 30 seconds, and quickly fish out with a slotted spoon. Run the vegetables under cold water to stop cooking. Drain well and set aside in a large mixing bowl.\nReturn the water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, then drain and run under cold water. Really try to shake off any extra water, then add to the vegetables. Add the tomatoes, and toss gently. You can toss with half of the sauce at this point, or serve the salad with dollops of the sauce on top - to be tossed at the table. It's prettier this way. Sprinkle with the basil/cilantro (and basil flowers if you have them) and serve. Serve the extra sauce on the side - any leftover makes a good dip later in the week.\nAdapted from the Pasta Salad with Tangy Sesame-Yogurt Sauce in Peter Berley's The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen.\nPrep time: 10 min  - \n   Cook time: 10 min   \n  \nPrint Recipe", "url": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/sesame-yogurt-pasta-salad-recipe.html", "image": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/mt-static/images/food/sesame_yogurt_pasta_salad.jpg", "cookTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "", "datePublished": "2011-08-09", "prepTime": "PT10M", "description": "An off-beat pasta salad made with stuffed pasta, seasonal vegetables, and a spice-forward, golden sesame yogurt sauce."}, {"name": "Millet Croquettes", "ingredients": "1 cup / 240 ml milk\n3 tablespoons clarified butter or olive oil\n1 small shallot, minced\n1 1/2 teaspoons fine grain sea salt\n3/4 cup / 5 oz / 145 g semolina flour\n1 1/2 cup / 2 oz finely chopped kale (remove stems first)\n1/3 cup / 20 g grated Gruyere cheese\n1 1/3 cups / 150 g cooked millet*\n30 basil leaves, chopped\n3 large eggs\n2 cups / 140 g whole wheat panko (or dried bread crumbs)", "url": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/millet-croquettes-recipe.html", "image": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/mt-static/images/food/savory_millet_croquettes.jpg", "cookTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 2 dozen croquettes.", "datePublished": "2012-10-17", "prepTime": "PT180M", "description": "Millet croquettes - crunchy crusted, basil and kale flecked for the flight to Delhi, along with a snapshot of how I packed."}, {"name": "Green Bean Slaw Recipe", "ingredients": "2 small handfuls (about 1/2 cup) golden raisins\n1 cup / 240 ml Moscato / sweet white wine\nDressing:\nyolk of one hard-boiled egg\n3 tablespoons creme fraiche or heavy cream\n1/3 cup / 80ml extra virgin olive oil\n1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar\n1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt\n-------------------------\n1/2 a small cabbage, cored and shredded very finely\n2 tablespoons white wine vinegar\n2 big handfuls green beans or haricot verts, very thinly sliced and cooked in a pot of boiling salted water for 20 seconds, drained (well) immediately, and cooled under cold running water. \nA big handful of arugula, roughly chopped\n2 handfuls (about 3/4 cup) toasted walnut halves\n2 handfuls of torn rustic bread, pan-toasted until golden in a big splash of olive oil\nA bit of shaved pecorino cheese", "url": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/green-bean-slaw-recipe.html", "image": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/mt-static/images/food/green_bean_slaw_recipe.jpg", "cookTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6-8.", "datePublished": "2010-09-27", "prepTime": "PT180M", "description": "A nut-studded, slaw-like green bean salad I made for lunch yesterday from a few things I picked up in the nearby shops and stalls here in the Testaccio neighborhood of Rome - moscato-soaked raisins, arugula, perorino cheese, croutons.
